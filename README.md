[![CI](https://github.com/giraffesyo/pdf/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=canary)](https://github.com/giraffesyo/pdf/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Robust PDF text extraction in pure Go — with glyph positions, hardened
against real-world (and hostile) files.

**Zero dependencies.** Built entirely on Go's standard library.

```go
import "github.com/giraffesyo/pdf"

doc, err := pdf.Extract(ctx, readerAt, size)
if err != nil { ... }

text := doc.Text()             // whole document, plain text
page := doc.Pages[0]
line := page.Text()            // per-page reconstruction
glyphs := page.Glyphs          // text, origin, advance, direction, size; Baseline(), Quad()
```

`Page.Text` reconstructs reading order from direction-aware glyph baselines,
and word boundaries are recovered from glyph gaps and font metrics — so PDFs
that encode no space characters at all still come out readable. Rotated and
vertical runs retain their reading direction. `Page.TextIn` and
`Page.GlyphsIn` extract a rectangular region.

## Extraction options and diagnostics

`Extract` is the permissive, all-pages convenience API. `ExtractWithOptions`
adds passwords, page ranges, strict mode, configurable resource limits,
artifact filtering, layout strategies, named CMap resolution, document
extras, and an optional OCR handoff:

```go
doc, err := pdf.ExtractWithOptions(ctx, readerAt, size, pdf.Options{
    Password: "secret",
    Pages:    []pdf.PageRange{{First: 2, Last: 5}},
    Strict:   true,
    Layout:   pdf.LayoutOptions{Mode: pdf.LayoutColumns},

    IgnoreArtifacts:    true,
    IncludeMetadata:    true,
    IncludeOutlines:    true,
    IncludeAnnotations: true,
    IncludeFormValues:  true,
})
```

Ligature presentation forms (`ﬁ`, `ﬂ`, `ﬀ`, `ﬃ`, `ﬄ`, `ﬅ`, `ﬆ`) fold to their
letter sequences by default, as `pdftotext` and pdf.js do, so extracted text
stays searchable; set `PreserveLigatures: true` to keep the raw codepoints.

Permissive extraction retains recoverable output and records conditions that
may have made it incomplete in `Document.Warnings` and `Page.Warnings`.
Strict mode returns the partial document with a `*pdf.StrictError` at the first
such condition. `pdf.ErrPasswordRequired` is available for `errors.Is`.

For large files, `ExtractPages` invokes a callback one page at a time and does
not retain page glyphs in the returned document:

```go
summary, err := pdf.ExtractPages(ctx, readerAt, size, opts, func(page pdf.Page) error {
    consume(page)
    return nil
})
```

The core remains dependency-free. Applications can implement `pdf.OCR` to
handle pages whose content streams produce no text. The callback receives the
original `io.ReaderAt`, file size, page number, and page geometry, so it can
invoke the renderer/OCR engine appropriate for the application.

## Why another PDF text extractor

This package grew out of converting large corpora of real-world documents
with [ledongthuc/pdf](https://github.com/ledongthuc/pdf), whose built-in
text extraction breaks on files that are common in the wild:

| Real-world file | ledongthuc/pdf | this package |
|---|---|---|
| Google Docs exports (text inside Form XObjects) | extracts nothing | full text |
| Word exports (Identity-H fonts + ToUnicode CMaps) | U+FFFD soup | decoded |
| Type3 fonts with ToUnicode but an /Encoding dict | control-char garbage | decoded |
| Td/T*-positioned text (most PDFs) | positions lost | positioned |
| Array token split across /Contents segments | lexer hangs forever | handled |
| Decompression bombs, stalled filter chains | unbounded CPU/memory | hard budgets |
| Cyclic page trees | stack overflow (crash) | rejected upfront |
| Inline images (BI/ID/EI) | derails the lexer | skipped cleanly |

Everything is implemented here, from ISO 32000 directly, with **no
external dependencies**: the object layer (cross-reference tables and
streams, object streams, hybrid references, stream filters, and
standard-handler decryption), the standard font encodings and Adobe Glyph
List, and everything from the content stream down — lexer, interpreter,
text state machine, CTM/Form-XObject handling, variable-width ToUnicode and
encoding CMaps, horizontal/vertical CID metrics, embedded TrueType/CFF/Type1
fallbacks, and tagged-PDF `/ActualText`.

Undecodable glyphs (no ToUnicode, no standard encoding) are **dropped, not
emitted as garbage**, so image-only or outlined-text PDFs yield empty
output you can detect, instead of plausible-looking noise.

Ligature presentation forms (`ﬁ`, `ﬂ`, `ﬀ`, `ﬃ`, `ﬄ`, `ﬅ`, `ﬆ`) — which
TeX-generated PDFs reach through `/Differences` glyph names — fold to their
letter sequences, as `pdftotext` and pdf.js do, so extracted text stays
searchable.

## Limitations

- No OCR: scanned pages and text converted to vector outlines have no text
  to extract unless the caller supplies an `OCR` implementation.
- Layout reconstruction is heuristic. Direction-aware, content-order, and
  column modes are available, but highly irregular tables may still require
  application-specific analysis of glyph quads.
- `Identity-H` and `Identity-V` CMaps are built in. Other named predefined
  CMaps are loaded through `Options.CMapResolver`; embedded CMap streams and
  `usecmap` inheritance are parsed natively.
- Image filters (DCT/JPX/CCITT/JBIG2) are not decoded — text extraction
  itself does not need them. An OCR implementation may use its own renderer.

## Benchmarks

The `benchmarks/` directory is a separate module (so its dependencies stay
out of this one) that compares extraction against
[ledongthuc/pdf](https://github.com/ledongthuc/pdf) and
[rsc.io/pdf](https://pkg.go.dev/rsc.io/pdf) over identical synthetic
corpora. The corpus checks both whether the expected text is recovered and
whether extraction completes safely. A comparator that returns incorrect
text, errors, or panics is excluded from the performance run for that
fixture.

Results below were measured on 2026-07-23 from the current worktree based
on commit `4d13aa9`, using Go `1.26.4` on macOS `26.5.1` (`darwin/arm64`,
Apple M5 Pro). Values are one run of
`go test -bench . -benchmem -run '^$' -count=1 ./...`; rerun on your own
hardware before making a performance decision.

| Flate-compressed content | ok | ok | incorrect text |

Latency (`ns/op`):

| Corpus | this package | ledongthuc/pdf |
|---|---:|---:|
| simple | 13,306 | 14,478 |
| Form XObject | 16,187 | incorrect text |
| Flate content | 20,431 | 20,407 |
| xref stream | 13,879 | 14,337 |
| object stream | 14,702 | 22,756 |
| RC4-encrypted | 34,550 | unsupported |

Memory (`B/op`) and allocations (`allocs/op`):

| Corpus | this package B/op | ledongthuc/pdf B/op | this package allocs/op | ledongthuc/pdf allocs/op |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| simple | 63,184 | 62,960 | 162 | 368 |
| Form XObject | 67,560 | incorrect text | 207 | incorrect text |
| Flate content | 108,624 | 107,888 | 180 | 386 |
| xref stream | 64,088 | 62,880 | 166 | 365 |
| object stream | 64,584 | 100,336 | 185 | 541 |
| RC4-encrypted | 95,808 | unsupported | 324 | unsupported |

To reproduce the support matrix and performance measurements:

```
cd benchmarks
go test -run TestCompetitorComparison -v ./...   # support matrix
go test -bench . -benchmem -run '^$' -count=1 ./... # raw results above
# For a less noisy local comparison, repeat and analyze the output:
go test -bench . -benchmem -run '^$' -count=5 ./...
```

The corpus is synthetic and deliberately small: it measures parser and
extractor behavior, not throughput on a representative production document
set. It does show that this package recovers the expected text from every
fixture, including Form XObjects, xref streams, object streams, and
encrypted files.

## Concurrency

`Extract` reconstructs the pages of a long document in parallel, on
cloned readers that share the cross-reference table and decryption key
but resolve objects independently, and `Document.Text` reconstructs their
text the same way. Output does not depend on it: pages, glyphs, and
warnings come out in the same order either way. `Options.Concurrency`
sets the number of workers — zero, the default, picks one per processor
up to a cap and falls back to sequential extraction for short documents,
and one extracts sequentially. Strict extraction, `OCR`, and
`CMapResolver` always run sequentially, so a caller's own code is never
invoked concurrently.

## Regression corpus

`testdata/corpus/` holds real documents — LaTeX, Word, and scanning-pipeline
output with embedded Type1, TrueType, and CFF fonts over multiple pages —
under redistributable licenses (see `testdata/corpus/NOTICE.md`).
`TestCorpusGolden` pins `Document.Text` for each file in
`testdata/corpus/golden/`, so a decoding or layout change is a reviewable
diff; accept an intentional change with
`go test -run TestCorpusGolden -update`. `TestCorpusAllocationBudget`
pins bytes and allocations per extraction for each file — stable across
machines, unlike timing — in `testdata/corpus/golden/budget.json`, and
fails when a file exceeds its budget by more than 15%
(`go test -run TestCorpusAllocationBudget -update` accepts a deliberate
change). `BenchmarkCorpus` measures `Extract` plus `Document.Text` over the
same files, and CI fails a pull request that regresses it against its base. Documents that cannot be
committed can be benchmarked locally with
`PDF_CORPUS_DIR=/path/to/pdfs go test -bench '^BenchmarkCorpus$' -run '^$' .`.

## pdftest

`github.com/giraffesyo/pdf/pdftest` builds minimal synthetic PDFs for
tests (in the spirit of `httptest`): document skeletons, composite fonts,
ToUnicode CMaps, Form XObjects, segmented content streams. This package's
own regression suite is built on it — every failure pattern above is
reproduced synthetically, with fuzzing on top.
